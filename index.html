	With a steady hand and expert know-how, plasterers can complete the tricky art of plastering walls in new properties as well as commercial building renovations. For every surface that needs to be covered, there are two coats needed: first coat is for making wallboard while second one will cover it all up with cement for an extra layer of protection.The plasterer is typically responsible for applying plaster on internal surfaces, ceilings and any other textures which are not necessarily structural. This way, they can achieve a decorative effect with no additional labor cost. Plastering Guildford will always be an essential part of the construction process – check out our gallery to see what we mean.
	
	Plastering is a fascinating trade that plasterers can complete in new homes, extensions for existing ones and commercial property renovations. They need two coats of plaster: the first coat to make the all-important wallboard; then it’s time to mix up some top quality cement before applying another layer on as you work your way upwards.
